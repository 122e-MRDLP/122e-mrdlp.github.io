# Jekyll Bootstrap

This is a Jekyll template made using bootstrap 4 that allows for modularity and many parts can be customized rather easily. With no extensive knowledge beyond knowing Markdown and editing config files.

You can find an example of the template on my personal page, [https://the-prism.github.io/website](https://the-prism.github.io/website)

## Configuration

The YAML file `_config.yml` contains the site configuration that can be changed, name links etc.

## Deployment

The project as is can be cloned and used with github pages or any other hosting platform that can build and deploy Jekyll websites.

For manual deployment, preview or development it can be easily achieved using Jekyll. The command `jekyll serve` will host a local web server to preview the final result. `jekyll build` will build the website the a folder `_site` which can be deployed to a web server as a static website.
